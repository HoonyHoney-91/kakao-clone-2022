## Usage
To view the different screens, open the corresponding HTML file in your preferred web browser. The CSS stylesheets in the "css" folder provide the visual design for each page. The project utilizes the Font Awesome library for icons.

Please note that some elements are hidden when viewed on screens larger than 645 pixels to ensure optimal mobile viewing experience.

Feel free to explore and interact with the app!
